# Machine-Learning---Spam-Mail-Prediction

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.

In this colab file, a prediction has made on mails, rather it is a spam mail or ham mail(Non spam mails) .
